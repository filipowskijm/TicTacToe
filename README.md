## Description
This is a simple web browser based Tic Tac Toe game created during a Software Development Bootcamp through NC State University. It's a two player game, with player one marking the X's and player two marking the O's, with the goal to acquire three letters in a line. Functionality wise, the game uses simple JavaScript functions and if/else statements to check if certain squares are clicked, and to register a readout to the players of who won the game or if it was a tie. There is also a reset button below the grid of squares to return the game to it's starting point when clicked. Through this project I reinforced my knowledge of basic JavaScript DOM manipulation, and continued my experience of testing code line by line to make sure it's working properly. Future modifications to this project could include creating better functions so the code is more readable and concise.
